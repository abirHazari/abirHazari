Hello, My name is Abir Hazari. i'm 16 years old.
I'm interested in learning web development. Currently studying HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
My goal is to become a P/MERN developer.

You can talk with me in discord: abir_hazari#4191

I like programming stuff. The process of learning and creating then fixing it is just exciting for me.
Other than that I go to highschool and spend my free time watching Anime/Manga and playing video games.
